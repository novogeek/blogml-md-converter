<p>"Same Origin Policy (SOP)" is one of the foundations of web security, which is built into web browsers. Web developers often do not understand this policy clearly and work with several misconceptions. The goal of this session is to show how important SOP is for the web, how it is bypassed using hacks and what HTML5 offers as a standard to overcome its limitations. Getting a full understanding of SOP isn't easy in a one hour session as it is relatively vast and complex. However, I have tried to simplify several ideas and put them in one place in the slides. Folks who couldn't attend the session will also be benefitted from the slides.</p>
<p>Along with my talk, there was an interesting talk "One Service, Any Device, Any Platform-Web API" by fellow MVP <a href="http://theshravan.net" target="_blank">Shravan</a>&nbsp;and "A Lap around the new Windows Azure" by our super techie <a href="http://www.allthingsazure.com/" target="_blank">Phani</a>, cofounder of <a href="http://www.brainscale.com" target="_blank">BrainScale</a>. It is really motivating to see close to 100 techies coming to learn cutting edge stuff over a weekend. That was a great time spent! See you in the next tech event. Happy coding :)</p>
