This is a converter which takes [BlogML](https://code.google.com/p/blogml/) generated by [Dotnet blog engine](http://dotnetblogengine.net/) 
and converts into markdown, as required by [Docpad](http://docpad.org). 
I've written it in NodeJS for exporting my blog, which is based on BlogEngine.NET 1.6.1.0 to Docpad. 
Do an "npm install" first and run it with "node app.js". 
The program picks "DummyBlogML.xml" (which contains all blog posts), splits it into individual markdown files and saves them into "md" directory.
I haven't tested it for latest versions of BlogML (Anyways, it is just a matter of changing a few lines in this code).
